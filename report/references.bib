abstract = {"The rapidly expanding field of galaxy formation lies at the interface between astronomy, particle physics, and cosmology. Covering diverse topics from these disciplines, all of which are needed to understand how galaxies form and evolve, this book is ideal for researchers entering the field. Individual chapters explore the evolution of the Universe as a whole and its particle and radiation content; linear and nonlinear growth of cosmic structure; processes affecting the gaseous and dark matter components of galaxies and their stellar populations; the formation of spiral and elliptical galaxies; central supermassive black holes and the activity associated with them; galaxy interactions; and the intergalactic medium. Emphasizing both observational and theoretical aspects, this book provides a coherent introduction for astronomers, cosmologists, and astroparticle physicists to the broad range of science underlying the formation and evolution of galaxies"--Provided by publisher.},

What are LINERS, BL Lacs, N galaxies, broad-line radio galaxies and radio-quiet quasars and how do they compare? This timely textbook answers these questions in a clear, comprehensive and self-contained introduction to active galactic nuclei - for graduate students in astronomy and physics. The study of AGN is one of the most dynamic areas of contemporary astronomy, involving one fifth of all research astronomers. This textbook provides a systematic review of the observed properties of AGN across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, examines the underlying physics, and shows how the brightest AGN, quasars, can be used to probe the farthest reaches of the Universe. This book serves as both an entry point to the research literature and as a valuable reference for researchers in the field.},

abstract = {The observational classification of active galaxies is reviewed and its likely meaning discussed. A large number of facts and ideas are examined, but a particular set of ideas is stressed as our best hope for a unified phenomenology, as follows. There is only one kind of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). The observed variety arises from three degrees of freedom: (1) Dust opacity, which produces the distinction between Type 1 and Type 2 AGN. (2) Viewing angle of a relativistic jet, which produces the distinction between blazars and Type 1 AGN. (3) Duty cycle of activity (i.e., fraction of time spent "on") which produces the distinction between radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN. The duty cycle may be related to the mass ofthe spheroidal component ofthe parent galaxy. A fourth degree of freedom is, of course, the overall luminosity. Also, it has recently become clear that there is considerable latitude in the physical condition of gas surrounding the nucleus. For theories of AGN to be presented with a real challenge, we need two things. First, a clear qualitative phenomenology, such as the possibility outlined above, must be decided upon. Second, we need to formulate a quantitative phenomenology.},

This textbook is a stimulating introduction for undergraduates in astronomy, physics and applied mathematics, taking a course on the physics of stars. It uniquely emphasizes the basic physical principles governing stellar structure and evolution. This second edition contains two new chapters on mass loss from stars and interacting binary stars, and new exercises. Clear and methodical, it explains the processes in simple terms, while maintaining mathematical rigor. Starting from general principles, this textbook leads students step-by-step to a global, comprehensive understanding of the subject. Fifty exercises and full solutions allow students to test their understanding. No prior knowledge of astronomy is required, and only a basic background in physics and mathematics is necessary"--Provided by publisher.},

We construct the mass function using a density-corrected maximum volume method, using masses corrected for the impact of optically thick and thin dust. We explore the galactic bivariate brightness plane (M⋆–μ), demonstrating that surface brightness effects do not systematically bias our mass function measurement above 107.5 M⊙. The galaxy distribution in the M–μ plane appears well bounded, indicating that no substantial population of massive but diffuse or highly compact galaxies are systematically missed due to the GAMA selection criteria. The GSMF is fitted with a double Schechter function, with \\$\\mathcal \\{M\\}^\\star =10^\\{10.78\\pm 0.01\\pm 0.20\\}\\,\\mathrm\\{M\\}\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$, \\$\\phi ^\\star \_1=(2.93\\pm 0.40)\\times 10^\\{-3\\}\\,h\_\\{70\\}^3\\$ Mpc−3, α1 = −0.62 ± 0.03 ± 0.15, \\$\\phi ^\\star \_2=(0.63\\pm 0.10)\\times 10^\\{-3\\}\\,h\_\\{70\\}^3\\$ Mpc−3 and α2 = −1.50 ± 0.01 ± 0.15. We find the equivalent faint end slope as previously estimated using the GAMA-I sample, although we find a higher value of \\$\\mathcal \\{M\\}^\\star\\$. Using the full GAMA-II sample, we are able to fit the mass function to masses as low as 107.5  M⊙, and assess limits to 106.5  M⊙. Combining GAMA-II with data from G10-COSMOS, we are able to comment qualitatively on the shape of the GSMF down to masses as low as 106 M⊙. Beyond the well-known upturn seen in the GSMF at 109.5, the distribution appears to maintain a single power-law slope from 109 to 106.5. We calculate the stellar mass density parameter given our best-estimate GSMF, finding \\$\\Omega \_\\star = 1.66^\\{+0.24\\}\_\\{-0.23\\}\\pm 0.97 \\,h^\\{-1\\}\_\\{70\\} \\times 10^\\{-3\\}\\$, inclusive of random and systematic uncertainties.}",

The magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r \\&lt; 19.4 mag over two-thirds and 19.8 mag over one-third of the area. The GSMF is determined from a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method. This efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number density versus redshift. With H0= 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, the GSMF is well described between 108 and 1011.5 M⊙ using a double Schechter function with , , α1=−0.35,  and α2=−1.47. This result is more robust to uncertainties in the flow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower Sloan Digital Sky Survey main sample (r \\&lt; 17.8 mag). The upturn in the GSMF is also seen directly in the i-band and K-band galaxy luminosity functions. Accurately measuring the GSMF below 108 M⊙ is possible within the GAMA survey volume but as expected requires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from low surface-brightness galaxies.}",

	abstract = {We use a sample of the 13 most luminous WMAP Galactic free–free sources, responsible for 33% of the free–free emission of the Milky Way, to investigate star formation. The sample contains 40 star-forming complexes; we combine this sample with giant molecular cloud (GMC) catalogs in the literature to identify the host GMCs of 32 of the complexes. We estimate the star formation efficiency ϵGMC and star formation rate per free-fall time ϵff. We find that ϵGMC ranges from 0.002 to 0.2, with an ionizing luminosity-weighted average 〈ϵGMC〉Q = 0.08, compared to the Galactic average ≈0.005. Turning to the star formation rate per free-fall time, we find values that range up to . Weighting by ionizing luminosity, we find an average of 〈ϵff〉Q = 0.14–0.24 depending on the estimate of the age of the system. Once again, this is much larger than the Galaxy-wide average value ϵff = 0.006. We show that the lifetimes of GMCs at the mean mass found in our sample is 27 ± 12  Myr, a bit less than three free-fall times. The GMCs hosting the most luminous clusters are being disrupted by those clusters. Accordingly, we interpret the range in ϵff as the result of a time-variable star formation rate; the rate of star formation increases with the age of the host molecular cloud, until the stars disrupt the cloud. These results are inconsistent with the notion that the star formation rate in Milky Way GMCs is determined by the properties of supersonic turbulence.}
