abstract = {How can we test if a supermassive black hole lies at the heart of every active galactic nucleus? What are LINERS, BL Lacs, N galaxies, broad-line radio galaxies and radio-quiet quasars and how do they compare? This timely textbook answers these questions in a clear, comprehensive and self-contained introduction to active galactic nuclei - for graduate students in astronomy and physics. The study of AGN is one of the most dynamic areas of contemporary astronomy, involving one fifth of all research astronomers. This textbook provides a systematic review of the observed properties of AGN across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, examines the underlying physics, and shows how the brightest AGN, quasars, can be used to probe the farthest reaches of the Universe. This book serves as both an entry point to the research literature and as a valuable reference for researchers in the field.},

We construct the mass function using a density-corrected maximum volume method, using masses corrected for the impact of optically thick and thin dust. We explore the galactic bivariate brightness plane (M⋆–μ), demonstrating that surface brightness effects do not systematically bias our mass function measurement above 107.5 M⊙. The galaxy distribution in the M–μ plane appears well bounded, indicating that no substantial population of massive but diffuse or highly compact galaxies are systematically missed due to the GAMA selection criteria. The GSMF is fitted with a double Schechter function, with \\$\\mathcal \\{M\\}^\\star =10^\\{10.78\\pm 0.01\\pm 0.20\\}\\,\\mathrm\\{M\\}\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$, \\$\\phi ^\\star \_1=(2.93\\pm 0.40)\\times 10^\\{-3\\}\\,h\_\\{70\\}^3\\$ Mpc−3, α1 = −0.62 ± 0.03 ± 0.15, \\$\\phi ^\\star \_2=(0.63\\pm 0.10)\\times 10^\\{-3\\}\\,h\_\\{70\\}^3\\$ Mpc−3 and α2 = −1.50 ± 0.01 ± 0.15. We find the equivalent faint end slope as previously estimated using the GAMA-I sample, although we find a higher value of \\$\\mathcal \\{M\\}^\\star\\$. Using the full GAMA-II sample, we are able to fit the mass function to masses as low as 107.5  M⊙, and assess limits to 106.5  M⊙. Combining GAMA-II with data from G10-COSMOS, we are able to comment qualitatively on the shape of the GSMF down to masses as low as 106 M⊙. Beyond the well-known upturn seen in the GSMF at 109.5, the distribution appears to maintain a single power-law slope from 109 to 106.5. We calculate the stellar mass density parameter given our best-estimate GSMF, finding \\$\\Omega \_\\star = 1.66^\\{+0.24\\}\_\\{-0.23\\}\\pm 0.97 \\,h^\\{-1\\}\_\\{70\\} \\times 10^\\{-3\\}\\$, inclusive of random and systematic uncertainties.}",

The magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r \\&lt; 19.4 mag over two-thirds and 19.8 mag over one-third of the area. The GSMF is determined from a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method. This efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number density versus redshift. With H0= 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, the GSMF is well described between 108 and 1011.5 M⊙ using a double Schechter function with , , α1=−0.35,  and α2=−1.47. This result is more robust to uncertainties in the flow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower Sloan Digital Sky Survey main sample (r \\&lt; 17.8 mag). The upturn in the GSMF is also seen directly in the i-band and K-band galaxy luminosity functions. Accurately measuring the GSMF below 108 M⊙ is possible within the GAMA survey volume but as expected requires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from low surface-brightness galaxies.}",

	abstract = {We use a sample of the 13 most luminous WMAP Galactic free–free sources, responsible for 33% of the free–free emission of the Milky Way, to investigate star formation. The sample contains 40 star-forming complexes; we combine this sample with giant molecular cloud (GMC) catalogs in the literature to identify the host GMCs of 32 of the complexes. We estimate the star formation efficiency ϵGMC and star formation rate per free-fall time ϵff. We find that ϵGMC ranges from 0.002 to 0.2, with an ionizing luminosity-weighted average 〈ϵGMC〉Q = 0.08, compared to the Galactic average ≈0.005. Turning to the star formation rate per free-fall time, we find values that range up to . Weighting by ionizing luminosity, we find an average of 〈ϵff〉Q = 0.14–0.24 depending on the estimate of the age of the system. Once again, this is much larger than the Galaxy-wide average value ϵff = 0.006. We show that the lifetimes of GMCs at the mean mass found in our sample is 27 ± 12  Myr, a bit less than three free-fall times. The GMCs hosting the most luminous clusters are being disrupted by those clusters. Accordingly, we interpret the range in ϵff as the result of a time-variable star formation rate; the rate of star formation increases with the age of the host molecular cloud, until the stars disrupt the cloud. These results are inconsistent with the notion that the star formation rate in Milky Way GMCs is determined by the properties of supersonic turbulence.}
