    \noindent In this paper I review some of the basic properties of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with emphasis on their tendency to be observed in host galaxies which are ``post-starburst.'' I discuss the physics of a second nuclear phenomenon, tidal disruption events (TDEs), in quiescent galaxies. I then present the spectra of eight such galaxies at $z < 0.1$ known to have recently hosted a tidal disruption event, observed with the XSHOOTER instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). I use the \textsc{Bagpipes} Python module to explore the effects of different star formation history (SFH) parameterisations on observed host spectra. By ``blind-fitting'' simulated spectra with a known SFH, I identify assumptions about the form of SFH which must be made in order to reliably detect past starbust activity in a now quiescent galaxy. I apply these assumptions to the spectra of the aforementioned TDEs, and find that their SFHs share the statistical behaviour of AGN---that they tend to occur in host galaxies which are post-starburst.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

% In this paper, I review the established literature on the phenomena of active
% galactic nuclei (AGN), their observational signatures, and the interpreted
% meaning of these signatures. I discuss the statistical properties of their host
% galaxy morphologies, with particular emphasis on the evidence that AGN
% preferentially occur in galaxies which are actively star forming
% (``starbursts'') or which have recently experienced a high rate of star
% formation (``post-starbursts''). I review the physics of a related phenomenon,
% tidal disruption events and their statistical properties. I then present newly
% gathered data on the Very Large Telescope.

The apparent connection between active galactic nuclei and star formation has long been established, if not fully explained. Evidence continues to mount for some kind of causal link between these phenomena, be it galactic wind, heating of the interstellar medium, or some as of yet undiscovered mechanism. Enquiry on this front has been limited by cosmic timescales. Although we can observe whether galaxies are actively emitting from their nuclei, observation of the ``duty cycle'' switching are rare.\cite{Lawrence_1987} So too for star formation. Although we can observe trends in cosmic star formation by peering at galaxies of higher and higher redshift, we still only see each galaxy snapshot, and signatures of recent star formation fade in a few \SI{}{\mega\year}. A remedy for this limitation was developed by Carnall et al. 2018: the \textsc{Bagpipes} Python module, which employs Bayesian inference to parameterise the most probable star formation history of an \textit{individual} galaxy from its spectrum.\cite{Carnall_2018} \textsc{Bagpipes} gives us new tools to probe the relationships between nuclear activity and star formation---an essential component of our understanding of galaxy evolution. With this software, we turn to a related nuclear phenomena, the tidal disruption event. Using the \textsc{Bagpipes} module and new spectral data on eight TDEs from the Very Large Telescope to investigate what features of their star formation history can be reliably inferred and if they, too, tend to occur in galaxies with recent star formation epochs. In doing so, we create a more complete picture of nuclear processes, their dynamics, and their impact on their host galaxies, and in doing so take another step towards a more unified theory of AGN.

\section{Theory \& Motivation}\label{sec:theory_and_motivation}
\subsection{Active Galactic Nuclei}\label{sec:active_galactic_nuclei}
The luminosity of most galaxies is dominated by stellar, gas, and dust emission. The stellar component is the aggregate of many stars at different temperatures emitting thermally as near-perfect blackbodies.\cite{Peterson_1997} The medium of interstellar gas emits thermally when heated by the host galaxy's constituent stars, and creates both absorption and emission features at the particular energies of common interstellar gases and metals. Larger grains of interstellar dust absorb and re-emit stellar light in the infrared region of the spectrum.\cite{Dyson_1997}

Differences between the spectra of elliptical and disk galaxies hinge mostly upon the age of their constituent stars. Ellipticals or ``early-types'' are characterised by red photometric colours associated with an older stellar population. The emit very little light at wavelengths less than \SI{4000}{\angstrom} and because their interstellar mediums are mostly comprised of hot ionised gas, their spectra feature mostly absorption lines typical of G- and K-type stars, with no emission lines.\cite{Mo_2010}

Disk or ``late-type'' galaxies are characterised by younger, bluer stars, neutral \isotope{HI} and molecular \isotope{H_2} hydrogen regions.Their spiral arms are defined by \isotope{HII} regions and dust features. The emit considerably more light at wavelengths below the \SI{4000}{\angstrom} break, in the blue and near-UV. Interstellar gas ionised by hot, young stars in these galaxies produces strong emission lines, such as the Balmer-series ($\mathrm{H\alpha}$, $\mathrm{H\beta}$, $\mathrm{H\gamma}$, and $\mathrm{H\delta}$), \isotope{OII} and \isotope{OIII} lines.\cite{Mo_2010}

A fraction ($\approx \sfrac{1}{3}$) of galaxies, however, feature tightly confined (\SI{10}{\kilo\parsec}) ``weak'' nuclear luminosity which is \textit{not} consistent with this model.\cite{McClure_2019} A smaller fraction ($\approx \sfrac{1}{100}$) exhibit nuclear luminosity which is a significant fraction of the host's stellar luminosity ($\approx 10\%$).\cite{Sparke_2000} These galaxies are said to have nuclei which are ``active'' and are referred to as active galactic nuclei (AGN).\cite{Peterson_1997}

Lower luminosity AGN fall into the broad categories of ``Seyferts'' and radio galaxies.\footnote{Additionally, a common and very low luminosity class of galaxies featuring low-ionisation nuclear emission regions (LINERs), the highly variable luminosity classes of BL Lac objects (blazars) and optically violent variables (OVVs), and narrow-line X-ray galaxies, which are Seyferts heavily reddened and extinguished by dust within the host.} Type 1 and 2 Seyferts typically occur in spiral galaxies, featuring broad and narrow emission lines, respectively. Broad-line radio galaxies (BLRGs) and narrow-line radio galaxies (NLRGs) are the elliptical analogues to Seyferts, but are additionally radio-loud.\cite{Peterson_1997}

Some AGN are sufficiently have power outputs many times that of a typical host galaxy. In these objects, luminosity from the nucleus completely obscures the host galaxy. These are believed to be exceptionally rare, and as such are only detected at very high redshifts. At such distances, they appear point-like or  ``quasi-stellar,'' and are so dubbed quasars.\cite{Peterson_1997} In general, AGN exhibit several key characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item highly luminous and compact appearance
    \item continuum luminosity which is not explicable by thermal emission
    \item variable luminosity over short timescales of days to months
\end{itemize}

Unlike the peaked blackbody emission from stars, AGN radiate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with a peak in the UV and secondary peaks in the near infrared and X-ray. The generally accepted explanation for continuum spectral emission of this magnitude is a hot accretion disk surrounding a supermassive black hole (SMBH).\cite{Sparke_2000} As matter falls into the black hole, its potential energy is converted to kinetic, which is dissipated by viscosity in the accretion disk to thermal energy, which is then radiated. In this model, material in the disc at a range of different temperatures accounts for continuum emission, while Doppler shifting of light emitted by disc material travelling at a range of velocities creates broad emission lines.\cite{Peterson_1997}

Emission from the central black hole is said to have different ``modes'' depending on its rate of mass accretion. In a ``steady'' mode, the SMBH is constantly fed by an infall of matter.\cite{Romero_Canizales_2016, Shields_1978} This infall is believed to be fueled by stellar wind driving matter from the halo of the host galaxy into the nucleus, where it is accreted and consumed. When accreting, these SMBHs can be as luminous as an entire galaxy (\textgreater\SI{e45}{\erg\per\second}), and it is this type of accretion which fuels Seyferts, radio galaxies, and their more luminous cousins, quasars.\cite{Kormendy_2013, Peterson_1997}

\subsection{The Starburst-AGN Connection}\label{sec:starburst_agn_connection}

% Observations like radio emission and continuum spectra were sometimes blamed on large scale formation of O- and B- type stars, and the subsequent deaths. LINER and some Seyfert-II galaxies were briefly thought to really be starburst galaxies.\cite{Lawrence_1987}

A significant fraction of AGN exhibit signatures of recent, large-scale star formation. These signatures include exceptionally blue photometric colours and strong \isotope{HII}-region-type emission lines, presumably gas ionised by hot, young O- and B-type stars. They also feature strong radio emissions, consistent with a high number of recent supernovae remnants.\cite{Peterson_1997}

Early investigations found that both Seyfert and radio galaxy luminosity was commonly related to the luminosity of the host galaxy, or in other words, to total stellar mass formed in that galaxy. A relationship emerged between spheroid or bulge luminosity and the luminosity of the constituent AGN in Seyferts and radio galaxies.\cite{Lawrence_1987}. Large scale surveys subsequently find a strongly positive correlation between the central black hole masses (formed by accretion) and the bulge luminosity and the stellar velocity dispersion (driven by star formation) in neighbouring galaxies.\cite{Veilleux_2008}

Other indicators of this relationship abound: Seyferts have intermediate age stars and red giants in their nuclei contributing to continuum luminosity---a strong signature of recent star formation. Additionally, more luminous Seyferts are found to have much younger stellar populations than less luminous Seyferts.\cite{Veilleux_2008}

The age of a stellar population can be characterised by several spectral indices. The $D_n(4000)$ index is defined as the ratio of flux from \SIrange{3850}{3950}{\angstrom} to that from \SIrange{4000}{4100}{\angstrom}. A high density of metal lines in this region means that young, hot stellar populations which ionise these metals will have a low $D_n$ with respect to older populations.\cite{Kauffmann_2003a} Studies by Kauffmann et al. 2003c found that the high luminosity AGN have substantially younger stellar populations (as characterised by $D_n$) than lower luminosity AGN, for fixed values of surface mass density. Quiescent galaxies do not exhibit this relationship, which suggests the most powerful AGN exist in galaxies which have recently undergone a short burst of star formation.\cite{Kauffmann_2003c}

Is this phenomenon really the result of a starburst, though, or simply ongoing star formation in the host galaxy? Another spectral index, the $\mathrm{H\delta}$ absorption line, or $\mathrm{H\delta_A}$, increases strongly in galaxies where star formation ended \textless \SI{1}{\giga\year} ago. Galaxies with continuous formation occupy a narrow locus within the $D_n(4000)$/$\mathrm{H\delta_A}$ plane, so the distance from this locus can be used to determine the ``burstiness'' of recent SFH in an AGN host. Analyses from Kaufmann et al. 2013c also find AGN to indeed have a much wider spread about this locus---much more variability in their SFHs than normal galaxies.\cite{Kauffmann_2003c}

All of these point to some causal relationship between these phenomena. Proposed mechanisms vary, but involve mechanical and/or radiative feedback from the starburst/AGN, which shuts off the fuel supply to the AGN or quenches star formation in the host galaxy. Mechanical energy from starbursts is provided by wind from O- and B- type stars for approximately the first \SI{6}{\mega\year}, and is then dominated by supernovae for approximately \SI{34}{\mega\year}. AGN may supply mechanical energy as high velocity gas outflow, which may be ejecta from the accretion disk or collimated jets accelerated by magnetic fields emanating from the accretion disk. Radiation pressure from very luminous starbursts or AGN may create Compton-heated wind or ionise hydrogen in the interstellar medium. All of the effect may inhibit the collapse of molecular clouds to form stars, or may shut off the supply of fuel to the central black hole.\cite{Veilleux_2008}

\subsection{Tidal Disruption Events}\label{sec:tidal_disruption_events}

A different type of nuclear phenomena are tidal disruption events (TDEs). In otherwise quiescent galaxies with low-level to no nuclear emission, spectra are dominated by stellar emission, as described in \S \ref{sec:active_galactic_nuclei}. Most galaxies, including quiescent ones, however, are still believed to host one or more SMBHs at their centres.\cite{Rees_1988} In these quiescent galaxies, it is possible for the central SMBH to be in an ``intermittent'' mode, wherein it is mostly starved of fuel, but occasionally consumes cold dust clouds or individual stars.\cite{Holoien_2016a, Rees_1988, Evans_1989}

If a star approaches a black hole of mass $>10^6M_\odot$ with a pericentre sufficiently close to be subject to tidal forces, the two can not simply be treated as point masses. Inside the tidal disruption radius $r_T$, orbital kinetic energy is greater than the gravitational binding energy of the star. A tidal bulge forms on the surface of the star, which rotates to face the black hole, but out of phase with its procession around the centre of gravity. A tidal torque acts on the star, and the distribution of velocities applied by this torque to different regions of the now elongated star tear it apart in a ``tidal disruption event.''\cite{Rees_1988, Evans_1989}

The radiative (and therefore observational) result of this event depends on the fate of the resulting stellar debris. Approximately half of the stellar material escapes unbound on various hyperbolic orbits, but more tightly bound debris may later return within the tidal disruption radius of the black hole on elliptical orbits.\cite{Rees_1988} Over successive periods on bound orbits, this material gradually accretes on to the surface of the black hole, creating a short-lived (\textless\SI{1}{\year}) in nuclear luminosity as disk viscosity converts the material's potential energy to thermal radiation.\cite{Evans_1989}

Observational data supports a slightly longer luminosity flare, with several distinct phases. For a 100-200 day period after peak bolometric luminosity, emission from the TDE flare is ``soft,'' or dominated by thermal emission in the UV/optical region, originating from the accretion disk and a short-lived corona of stellar ejecta. Approximately 500 days after peak UV/optical luminosity, this transitions to a phase of ``hard'' emission, which is dominated by a power-law spectrum of higher energy photons, before finally returning to a quiescent mode.\cite{Wevers_2021} Observational data suggests that some accretion disks are stable for up to 5-10 years after peak luminosity.\cite{van_Velzen_2019}

For reasons similar to those reviewed in \S\ref{sec:starburst_agn_connection}, the precise dynamics of these phenomena are of particular relevance to galactic evolution models. Like steadily luminous Seyferts and radio galaxies, feedback from the accretion process may have consequences for the galactic star formation rate, or for AGN quenching. Analytical and numerical models predict the velocity of stellar ejecta to be of sufficient order to shock the interstellar medium (ISM) and inhibit steady accretion which would otherwise be inevitable in a galaxy hosting a SMBH.\cite{Evans_1989} As the ejecta are braked by the ISM, their kinetic energy is thermalized, heating the ISM, possibly enough to stop the collapse of molecular \isotope{H_2} clouds into star forming nurseries.\cite{Rees_1988}

Like AGN, observed TDEs often appear in galaxies which bear the signatures of recent star formation, but our ability to investigate the particular dynamics between the related processes of AGN, TDEs, and star formation is limited by the timescales on which these processes occur. Although we can peer at high redshift galaxies to determine \textit{trends} in galactic evolution, we can not observe the evolution of \textit{individual} galaxies in real time. In this project, I develop methods for quantifying the star formation histories of individual galaxies, and apply them to the host galaxies of eight TDEs.

To do this, I utilised spectroscopic and photometric data on eight galaxies which hosted a tidal disruption event between 2014 and 2020. Table \ref{tab:xshooter_data} lists the targets, which were observed between September and December of 2020, with the XSHOOTER instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). They are all of similar magnitude and moderate redshift, all  being located at $z<0.1$. At such distances, they occupy little real estate on a CCD (see Fig. \ref{fig:xshooter_hosts}), but the XSHOOTER instrument provides detailed, ground-based spectroscopy of the TDE hosts, with flux bins of width $\Delta\lambda=\SI{0.2}{\angstrom}$ below \SI{10200}{\angstrom} and $\Delta\lambda=\SI{0.6}{\angstrom}$ above \SI{10200}{\angstrom}. Some of the spectra featured strong telluric lines from the Earth's atmosphere, but the errors on these fluxes can be exaggerated to ensure \textsc{Bagpipes} does not overfit them, as described in \S \ref{sec:bagpipes_module}.

  \caption{Parameterised star formation history and simulated spectrum with \textsc{Bagpipes}.}
  \label{fig:bagpipes_example_simulation}
\end{figure}

\textsc{Bagpipes} is a module for Python 3, implemented by Carnall et al. 2018. Its moniker is an acronym for Bayesian Analyses of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation. \textsc{Bagpipes} constructs model galaxies from a variety of parameters, such as the form of the SFH, observed redshift, dust attenuation, and nebular emission. From this model, \textsc{Bagpipes} generates model spectral energy distributions, as they would be observed if they were real galaxies. The luminosity per unit rest-frame wavelength $L_\lambda(\lambda)$, from sum of four ``ingredients'':

\begin{itemize}
  \item The SFH, $\mathrm{SFR}(t)$, which is a linear combination of one or more of the functional forms described below.
  \item Simple stellar population models, $\mathrm{SSP}(a,\lambda,Z)$ which give the spectral energy distribution for a total stellar mass of age $a$ given by the SFH, on the basis of an initial mass function (IMF) and the metallicity of stellar population or populations.
  \item The transmission function of the ionised ISM, $T^+(a,\lambda)$ which determines how starlight is absorbed and re-emitted by hot gas regions.
  \item Finally, the transmission function of the neutral ISM, $T^0(a,\lambda)$, which determines how starlight is absorbed and remitted by cold gas and dust regions.\cite{Carnall_2018}
\end{itemize}

\noindent These are combined to give the galactic rest-frame spectrum:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:luminosity_per_rframe_wavelength}
  L_\lambda(\lambda) =
  \sum_{j=1}^{N_c} \sum_{i=1}^{N_a}
  \mathrm{SFR}_j(t_i)
  \mathrm{SSP}(a_i,\lambda,Z_j)
  T^+(a_i,\lambda)
  T^0(a_i,\lambda)
  \Delta a_i
\end{equation}

\noindent Where $i$ runs over the number of stellar age bins defined by \textsc{Bagpipes} and $j$ runs over the components of the SFH.\cite{Carnall_2018} An example spectrum from a parameterised SFH is given in Fig. \ref{fig:bagpipes_example_simulation}. The parameterised SFH, is a linear combination of one or more of the following functional forms. An exponentially decaying burst with form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:tau_model}
  \mathrm{SFR}(t) \propto
  \begin{cases}
    \exp\left({-\frac{t-T_0}{\tau}}\right) & t > T_0, \\
    0 & t < T_0
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent A delayed exponentially decaying component:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:delayed_model}
  \mathrm{SFR}(t) \propto
  \begin{cases}
    (t-T_0)\exp\left({-\frac{t-T_0}{\tau}}\right) & t > T_0, \\
    0 & t < T_0
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent A lognormal form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:lognormal_model}
  \mathrm{SFR}(t) \propto
  \frac{1}{t\sqrt{2\pi\tau^2}}
  \exp\left({-\frac{\left(\ln{t-t_0}\right)^2}{2\tau^2}}\right)
\end{equation}

\noindent Defined by Gladders et al. 2013, where $t$ is the elapsed time since the big bang, $t_0$ is the logarithmic decay time, and $\tau$ sets rise and decay timescale.\cite{Gladders_2013} \textsc{Bagpipes}, however, parameterises this as $t_{max}$, the time since the big bang at the peak rate of star formation and $2\sigma$, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the star formation rate.\cite{Carnall_2019b} Finally, \textsc{Bagpipes} allows a more versatile double power law parameterisation:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dblplaw_model}
  \mathrm{SFR}(t)\propto
  \left[
  \left(\frac{t}{\tau}\right)^{\alpha} +
  \left(\frac{t}{\tau}\right)^{-\beta}
  \right]

\end{equation}

\noindent Which usefully decouples the rising $\alpha$ and falling $\beta$ slopes of the star formation, at the expense of an additional parameter in a fit which is already of high dimensionality and of increased computational resources.\cite{Carnall_2018} Each of the above parameterisations include a parameter each for the total stellar mass $M_\star$ formed by the component and the metallicity $Z$ of the stars formed. It is possible to include ``bursts'' of fixed mass such that:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:burst_model}
  \mathrm{SFR}(t)\propto
  M_\star \delta(t-T_0)
\end{equation}

\noindent As a matter of semantics, such ``bursts'' are not necessarily synonymous with the type of ``starburst'' activity for which we are searching. The starburst component may take one of any of these forms.

Global parameters for the entire model galaxy include the observed redshift $z_obs$, the velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$ of the stellar population,the logarithm of the nebular ionisation rate $\log{U}$, and the extinction $A_V$ in magnitudes due to dust in the galaxy, which contribute to the summation in Eq. \ref{eq:luminosity_per_rframe_wavelength}.

The real power of \textsc{Bagpipes}, however, is that it can also do the inverse: take in an observed spectrum and infer the most likely star formation history for that galaxy. By utilising Bayes' Theorem for some new data $\mathcal{D}$, a hypothesis $\mathcal{H}$ with parameter vector:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:bayes_theorem}
  P(\Theta|\mathcal{D},\mathcal{H}) =
  \frac
  {P(\mathcal{D}|\Theta,\mathcal{H})P(\Theta|\mathcal{H})}
  {P(\mathcal{D}|\mathcal{H})}
\end{equation}

\noindent And the \textsc{MultiNest} linear algebra sampling method implemented by Buchner et al. 2014 in \textsc{PyMultiNest} to determine the probability that a model galaxy spectrum (the hypothesis) described by Eq. \ref{eq:luminosity_per_rframe_wavelength} is a fit for the observed spectrum (the data), \textsc{Bagpipes} produces a posterior distribution of SFHs and their associated parameters.\cite{Carnall_2018, Buchner_2014}

  \label{tab:star_lifetimes_densities}
\end{table}

Many of the challenges in fitting spectra to SFHs are due to the limitations of stellar population fitting, whereby the total luminosity and the ratio of blue to red stars constituent in a host galaxy is used to infer the age of stellar formation components. The main sequence lifetime of a star is given by\cite{Prialnik_2010}:

\begin{equation}
  T_{MS} \propto \left(\frac{M}{M_\odot}\right)^{-2}
\end{equation}

\noindent From this we obtain the typical main-sequence lifetimes for stars of different Harvard spectral classifications, given in Table \ref{tab:star_lifetimes_densities}. From this data, the limitations of stellar population fitting are immediately apparent. Due to the inverse power law relationship between mass and main-sequence lifetime, small reductions in the initial mass (and therefore, main-sequence temperature) of stars result in dramatic increases in main-sequence lifetime. While on the main-sequence, the luminosity and colour of these long-lived stars varies little.\cite{Prialnik_2010} If, for example, the hottest stars in a stellar population are G-type stars, then stellar population fitting may reasonably find that population to be anywhere between \SI{3}{Gyr} and \SI{11}{Gyr} old. This kind of temporal resolution is comparable to the age of the universe, but star formation rates are believed to vary on much smaller timescales.\cite{Kauffmann_2003c} If star forming processes create new stars with initial masses according to some initial mass function (IMF), then star formation of sufficient total mass formed will always create some stars of each spectral type. But once the population of A-type stars, with lifetimes on the order of \SI{100}{Myr}, die out completely, it becomes increasingly difficult to pinpoint the precise age of that formation.

Indeed, observations by Glenn et al. 2001 reproduced in Table \ref{tab:star_lifetimes_densities} show that our own Milky Way, despite being a relatively young, blue galaxy, is nevertheless mostly populated by cool red dwarves, whose lifetimes are many times that of the current age of the universe.

\section{Blind Fitting with \textsc{Bagpipes}}\label{sec:blind_fitting}

Because stellar population fitting is so sensitive to prior constraints, I first sought to determine what SFHs could reliably be fit by \textsc{Bagpipes} before turning it on the XSHOOTER data. To do this, I performed ``blind-fitting'' trials, whereby I simulated observed spectra from a known, priori SFH and then fit these mock spectra with \textsc{Bagpipes} to see what priors are necessary to reproduce the true SFH.\footnote{For clarity, I will hereafter use the dative ``priori'' to describe properties of the simulated galaxy, the nominative ``prior(s)'' to describe the parameters and parameter ranges used to blind-fit the simulated galaxy, and ``posterior'' to describe the fitted parameters.}

Because model galaxy spectra are simulated, their flux values are ``exact'' and don't have associated uncertainties. So before they can be fit, they need to have noise added to them. The particular choice of uncertainty to add is somewhat arbitrary, but I tried to mimic the signal to noise ratio of the XSHOOTER data when doing this. At wavelengths below approximately \SI{3500}{\angstrom}, noise in the XSHOOTER data is on the same order of magnitude as the signal. Between approximately \SIrange{3500}{9000}{\angstrom}, noise is one or two orders of magnitude less than the signal, and at longer wavelengths, the $S/N$ ratio decreases considerably.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{ASASSN14li_SN_hist}
  \caption{Histograms of the $S/N$ ratio of flux values for the eight XSHOOTER targets. Note that some very low $S/N$ ratios are due to deliberately exaggerated errors on Telluric lines, as described in \S \ref{sec:xshooter_data}.}
  \label{fig:sig_to_noise_histograms}
\end{figure}

To produce similar uncertainties, I select a Monte Carlo error for each flux value $f$ from a Gaussian distribution with $\mu=f$ and $\sigma=0.1f$, and assign the error to that flux value. This doesn't perfectly reproduce the wavelength-dependent uncertainty of the XSHOOTER data, but errors sampled from the wings of the Gaussian reproduce some of the very high and very low $S/N$ ratios in the XSHOOTER data while maintaining the statistical behaviour illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:sig_to_noise_histograms}: that most errors are one or two orders of magnitude less than their associated data points.

The minimum parameter space covered by a \textsc{Bagpipes} fit includes a single function SFH and its associated parameters, a redshift, a velocity dispersion, and dust attenuation: a 7-dimensional parameter space. More nuanced models which account for nebular emission, birth cloud lifetimes, and multiple SFH components quickly grow to be very high-dimensional and therefore computationally expensive. My two component fits were 13- or 14-dimensional, depending on whether or not a double power-law function was included, and each run took many hours on the Cuillin computing cluster at the Royal Observatory Edinburgh. For these reasons, it's essential to fit in a way that is computationally efficient.

As an aside, it's import to consider whether real star formation histories are really like this. As discussed in \S\S\ref{sec:active_galactic_nuclei} and \ref{sec:tidal_disruption_events}, star formation histories do not evolve on sufficiently short timescales to observe them directly, but we can measure trends in galactic star formation over varying redshifts. Stellar population dating of high redshift galaxies suggests that cosmic star formation peaks in most galaxies sometime around $1.5 < z < 3$, a period sometimes referred to as ``cosmic noon,'' and that star formation is ``quenched'' after this time.\cite{Feldmann_2016} So there are compelling reasons to believe that most of a galaxy's stellar mass should be formed in some bulk formation in the distant past, with possibly variable, low-level star formation since that epoch. The simulated spectra I produced for blind-fitting all conform to this paradigm, so the blind fits are a test how reliably this kind of SFH can be reconstructed from a spectrum. If, however, true SFHs do not follow this trend, fits performed with priors that reflect this paradigm will still tend to find star formation histories that tend to affirm that paradigm---a form of model bias. In the next four sections, I detail four ``runs'' or sets of priors and related algorithms, hereafter referred to as R1, R2, R3 and R4. In each run, I test different priors and fitting routines to reconstruct a known star formation history from its simulated spectrum, while balancing the need to minimise model bias with the need for computational austerity.

As discussed in \S \ref{sec:bagpipes_module}, computational resources are a serious consideration when devising priors for a \textsc{Bagpipes} fit. So for my first fitting run, I tried to first establish the functional form of the old, bulk star formation, and then determine whether or not a more recent burst improved the fit. This advantageously limits the first three fits to only ten dimensions, and runs only one subsequent 12-dimensional fit.

I first fit each of the functional forms given in Tab. \ref{tab:r1_priors}. To determine which of these best fits the spectral data, I calculate the reduced chi-squared value:

\begin{equation}
  \chi^2 = \sum_{i}\frac{(O_i - C_i)^2}{\sigma_i^2}
\end{equation}

\noindent For each fit using the simulated data $O_i$, their errors $\sigma_i$, and model spectrum $C_i$ fit by \textsc{Bagpipes}. I select the functional form with the best fit (lowest chi-squared value) and run a second fit with that functional form in linear combination with a delta function with priors given in Tab. \ref{tab:r1_burst_priors}. For this second component, I constrain the age of the burst to be less than $T_low$, which taken from the median posterior age of the bulk component, i.e. we are only interested in detecting bursts which occur \textit{after} the bulk star formation. I perform a final reduced chi-squared calculation for this fit, and compare it to the single component fit. If the old+burst form reduces the chi-squared statistic, then I consider this a positive burst detection. If not, I consider the single component fit to be the best, and take there to be no burst in the SFH.

Unfortunately, this seldom detected priori bursts in the posterior. Upon inspection, I found that when fitting the bulk component without a burst, \textsc{Bagpipes} favours posterior parameters with a much younger bulk formation than the priori SFH in order to account for blue stars formed in the burst. Constraining the age of the burst to be younger than this biases the second fit towards lower burst masses and young bulk formation. Since the burst can not be sufficiently old to account for blue stars in the spectrum, the bulk formation can not be weighted back towards an older stellar population. It also dubiously assumes that the functional form with the best single component fit will also be the best fit in linear combination with a burst, which is not necessarily the case. For these reasons, I chose to abandon this approach.

  \label{tab:r2_r3_priors}

I decided that in order to avoid suppressing the burst mass with young bulk formation, both the age of the burst and the bulk formation had to be allowed to vary over a wider prior parameter space. Without the need to constrain the burst by the median age of the bulk formation, I was able to fit the three functional forms from R1 \textit{or} the more versatile double power law function (which has no posterior age distribution). In these runs, I also utilised a more physically realistic, exponentially decaying burst function instead of the burst described by Eq. \ref{eq:burst_model}. This burst is allowed to vary over a much larger parameter space:

\begin{table}[h]

  \begin{tabular}{l l r r l}
    Model       & Parameter   & Symbol/Unit         & Range    & Prior   \\

  \caption{Prior parameters and their distributions for the burst component, as applied in the R2 and R3 round of blind fits.}
  \label{tab:r2_r3_burst_priors}
\end{table}

The only difference between R2 and R3 is that in R3, the prior redshift $z$ of the galaxy is constrained to be $z_{obs} - 0.001 \leq z \leq z_{obs} + 0.001$, where $z_{obs}$ is the observational redshift. (For blind-fitting, the ``observational'' redshift was simply taken to be the priori redshift). R2 simply let this prior vary between 0 and 0.1, a range which included all the priori galaxies and the XSHOOTER targets. R3 did produce marginally more accurate posterior redshifts, but both runs still failed to reliably detect the priori bursts. Rather, they continued to favour younger bulk formation than in the priori galaxy and suppressing high mass bursts in the posterior distribution.

\subsection{Selecting Physically Reasonable Priors}\label{sec:prior_selection}

I concluded from R2 and R3 that, actually, the age of the bulk formation had so be constrained to some range more consistent with observation.

Velocity dispersion of constituent stars is allowed to vary between

The ionization parameter for nebular emission is allowed to vary between logU=-4 and logU=-2, a very low and very high rate of (molecular?) ionization.

The lifetime of the stellar birth clouds was chosen to be a normal distribution about ${t_{BC}=17Myr}$ with ${\sigma=4Myr}$, consistent with typical cloud lifetimes in the Milky Way, as determined by Murray 2011\cite{Murray_2011}.

\subsection{ASASSN-14li, $z=0.0206$}\label{sec:ASASSN-14li}

A very important discovery was made with ASASSN-14li.Initially identified in the optical, this is one of the few TDEs toshow evidence of both thermal and non-thermal components.ASASSN-14li was discovered by the All-Sky AutomatedSurvey for Supernovae(ASAS-SN; Shappee et al.2014)on2014 November 22 at the center of the nearby(z=0.0206,D=90.3 Mpc)post-starburst galaxy PGC 043234(Holoien et al.2016). PGC 043234 appears to be the remnant of a recentmerger that likely hosted a low-luminosity Type II AGN priorto the TDE(Prieto et al.2016). Holoien et al.(2016)present theoptical, UV, and X-ray properties of the event, followed byadditional X-ray(Miller et al.2015; Brown et al.2016),UV(Cenko et al.2016), radio(Alexander et al.2016; van Velzenet al.2016, and this work), and mid-IR(Jiang et al.2016)studies.\cite{Romero_Canizales_2016}

\end{figure}

Although the redshift was originally reported as $z=0.02$, later spectra showed that the redshift of the host galaxy is $z=0.0484$, which was used in this fit.\cite{Arcavi_2015, Holoien_2016b}

Note that Wevers et al. 2021 gives this redshift as 0.059

Important to note that Blagorodnova et al. 2017 estimates this redshift to be $z=0.016328$, although this fit was run with $z=0.018$.\cite{Blagorodnova_2017}
